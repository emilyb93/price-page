# Responsive Pricing Page

You can find a hosted version of this repo [here](https://pricing-page-murex.vercel.app/)

The purpose of this project was to create a responsive pricing page with 3 different plans, that adjusts well to different screen sizes and has different styling based on the card you are hovering over. I was also asked to include a dark/light mode toggle of my own design. I chose a sun and moon from React Icons to visualise this to the user, with a button that stays at the bottom right for easy access.

This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the React application on your local machine, including how to run Storybook.
